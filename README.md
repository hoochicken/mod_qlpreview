# mod_qlpreview

This module display a link to the actual generated page of a menu item.
Attach it to module position 'toolbar'.

Display a button linking to generated/administrated page.

* Problem: You administrate a menu item and you want to see the actual page generate, without clicking 5 times through your website's menu.
* Solution: Display a button within menu item administration that links straight to the very page of your website.

The module is self explanatpry. Just install it and go to a menu item. There you should already see the button :-)
