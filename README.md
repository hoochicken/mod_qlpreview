This module display a link to the actual generated page of a menu item.

* Problem: You administrate a menu item and you want to see the actual page generate, without clicking 5 times through your website's menu.
* Solution: Display a button within menu item administration that links straight to the very page of your website.

The module is self explanatory. 

* Just install it 
* Attach the module to module position 'toolbar'.
* Go to a menu item. 
* => There you should already see the button :-)
